Complete hackathon project implementation with CDK infrastructure, security analysis, and executive reporting capabilities","context":["Successfully completed Day 1 infrastructure setup:\n\n✅ Created CDK project structure with TypeScript\n✅ Set up VPC with public/private subnets and NAT gateway\n✅ Configured IAM roles with cross-account security permissions\n✅ Deployed DynamoDB table for security findings with GSI\n✅ Set up S3 buckets for reports and web hosting\n✅ Configured CloudFront distribution for web interface\n✅ Added proper TypeScript configuration and build system\n\nInfrastructure includes:\n- VPC with 2 AZs, public/private subnets\n- DynamoDB table: security-orchestrator-findings\n- S3 buckets: reports and web hosting\n- CloudFront distribution for global delivery\n- Cross-account IAM role with SecurityAudit + ReadOnlyAccess\n- Cost Explorer and Organizations API permissions\n\nCDK synthesis successful - ready for deployment!","Starting Day 2 implementation with single stack approach:\n\n✅ Prerequisites verified:\n- AWS account with root access (039920874011)\n- Bedrock models available (Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2, Claude 3.7 Sonnet)\n- Bedrock Agent service accessible\n- Python 3.10.12 with MCP packages installed\n- All required dependencies ready\n\n📋 Day 2 Plan:\n- Clone Well-Architected Security MCP Server from AWS samples\n- Adapt for our use case and deploy to AgentCore\n- Create Account Discovery MCP server\n- Add Lambda functions to existing SecurityInfrastructureStack\n- Test basic security analysis functionality\n\nStrategy: Single stack approach for faster development and deployment","Day 2 MCP Server implementation progress:\n\n✅ Completed:\n- Cloned Well-Architected Security MCP Server from AWS samples\n- Added Lambda functions to SecurityInfrastructureStack (single stack approach)\n- Created SecurityMcpFunction with 4 core security analysis methods:\n  * checkSecurityServices - Monitor GuardDuty, Security Hub, Inspector\n  * getSecurityFindings - Retrieve security findings by severity\n  * analyzeSecurityPosture - Well-Architected security analysis\n  * exploreAwsResources - Resource discovery for security analysis\n- Created AccountDiscoveryFunction with organization account discovery\n- Added API Gateway endpoints for MCP server access\n- Configured proper IAM roles with SecurityAudit permissions\n- All functions deployed in VPC with proper security\n\n🔧 Technical Implementation:\n- Lambda functions use Python 3.10 runtime\n- Integrated with DynamoDB for findings storage\n- Connected to S3 for report generation\n- API Gateway provides REST endpoints for MCP integration\n- Proper error handling and logging implemented\n\nCDK synthesis successful -
