Security runtime provides analyze_security_posture and get_security_findings tools. Cost runtime provides get_security_costs, calculate_security_roi, and get_roi_trends tools. Both integrate properly with Memory primitive for historical data storage.","Created AgentCore configuration files (.bedrock_agentcore.yaml), tested runtimes successfully (all tools working), created Memory setup script, and environment configuration files. AgentCore foundation is now solid.","Created AgentCore configuration files (.bedrock_agentcore.yaml), tested runtimes successfully (all tools working), created Memory setup script, and environment configuration files. AgentCore foundation is now solid.","Completed major integration components: Created Bedrock Agent OpenAPI schema, built Lambda orchestration function, created deployment scripts, configured Bedrock Agent setup, created IAM roles setup, and successfully tested end-to-end flow. All integration tests pass - architecture is working correctly from AgentCore → Lambda → Bedrock Agent.","Final task completed! Updated README with complete rebuild status, test results, and deployment instructions. All 20 tasks are now complete - the Security ROI Calculator has been fully rebuilt from ground up with proper AgentCore Memory Primitive integration, working Lambda orchestration, Bedrock Agent configuration, and comprehensive testing.
